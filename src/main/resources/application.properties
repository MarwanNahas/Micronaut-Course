# its update so when we restart the tables will be created automatically nu t this auto update option to create the tables should not be used for production therefore we will use flyway for easy database migrations
# here comes the question that how should you create database tables and make all the necessary updates as when the schema evolves afters some time u can do this manually but the problem is that you may have large number of developers working on ur project and multiple environments so how will u maintain this versioning of updates and make sure an update created by one developer reaches out to all the required systems therefore the answer is database migrations and we will use flyway
# flyway offers : Recreate DB from scratch so whenever a new developer joins a team or we want to create a new environment this can create all / Maintains state of the database (makes it clear all the time what state our database is in and it also migrates in a deterministic way from your current version of the DB to a newer version and check which SQL scripts are already applied and which are the new ones that should be applied )
# How does flyway do it : It creates a flyway-schema-history table which keeps track of all the migrations this table will be used to track the state of the database / Now according to the configuration fly we will scan the location for the migration scripts these will be compared against the schema table so that we will know which are the new migrations that needs to be applied / ensures that no existing file has been modified / Migrations are sorted based on their version number and applied in that order
# so we will remove auto update and put it none 
# jpa.default.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update
jpa.default.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=none
jpa.default.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.show_sql=true

# add this for flyway
# We will create DB migration folder in the resources folder
